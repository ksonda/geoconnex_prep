THe purpose of this project is to genereate PIDs/redirects for a reference set of U.S. Public Water Systems (PWS). PWS are identified by the USEPA for Safe Drinking Water Act regulatory purposes by the PWS ID, of the form STXXXXXXX. The full list of PWS/ PWSIDs is available from ECHO [here](https://echo.epa.gov/files/echodownloads/SDWA_downloads.zip)


These boundaries are processed into .gpkg for hosting on info.geoconnex.us, and are available at https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/4a22e88e689949afa1cf71ae009eaf1b/
