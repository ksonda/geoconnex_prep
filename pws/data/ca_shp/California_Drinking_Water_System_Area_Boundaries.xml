            <abstract>In order to provide an accurate data set of service area boundaries for California drinking water systems, the Division of Drinking Water of the California Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB DDW) has undertaken a project to vet and verify the data collected by the Tracking California's Water Boundary Tool (WBT).SWRCB DDW downloaded a copy of the current water system service areas loaded in the WBT as of June 27, 2019. Additional attribute fields indicating verification status, verification staff and system type were appended to the data set. SWRCB DDW staff are reviewing and validating the displayed boundaries of each service area as well as contacting the service providers regarding necessary corrections. The verification status of any particular service area may be found in the Verification Status field.For any questions regarding this dataset, please contact the Program Liaison Unit at 916-449-5158 or DDW-PLU@waterboards.ca.gov.</abstract>
